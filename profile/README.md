### Identifying digital biomarkers of illNess activity and Treatment REsPonse In Bipolar Disorder

Bipolar disorder (BD) is a highly prevalent disorder featuring pathological mood fluctuations, which are still precariously identified with subjective retrospective reports and scales. Despite pharmacological treatments being quite efficacious, variability in response is poorly understood. Biomarkers capable of identifying illness activity and predicting treatment response may enable a better definition of criteria to establish timely and personalized treatments. Digital biomarkers able to provide real-time patient monitoring will help optimize safe and time-effective patient management. Electrodermal activity (EDA) hyporeactivity - denoting autonomic dysfunction- has long been recognized as a strong predictive biomarker for both unipolar and bipolar depression as well as suicidal behavior. However, until a few years ago, capturing EDA was only possible with costly and complex laboratory equipment. Novel research-grade wearables now allow to continuously capture of EDA in addition to actigraphy and heart rate variability (HRV), which are also closely linked to BD illness activity while reporting real-time data of these patients.
